            <h3>Who am I</h3>
            <p>My name is Sosina Sisay, and I was born in Gonder. I completed my primary and secondary education in Bahir Dar. Throughout my academic journey, I have discovered that I excel in areas where I am deeply engaged, and I am dedicated to performing tasks to the best of my abilities.

            <br>

            <p>
                My passion for coding and software development began during high school. I was drawn to the world of programming and found immense joy in solving problems through code. This passion grew over time, fueling my desire to pursue a career in software engineering.
            </p>

            <br>

            
            <p>Currently, I am a third-year software engineering student at Addis Ababa University. This educational journey has provided me with a solid foundation in various programming languages, software development methodologies, and problem-solving techniques. I have had the opportunity to work on diverse projects, both individually and in teams, which have further honed my coding skills and expanded my knowledge.</p>
            
            <br>

            <p>
                Throughout my studies, I have embraced the challenges and complexities of software engineering, always seeking opportunities to learn and grow. I am constantly exploring new technologies, frameworks, and best practices to stay up to date with the ever-evolving field.

Moreover, I believe that being a software engineer is not just about writing code but also about creating solutions that have a positive impact on people's lives. I strive to develop software that is user-friendly, efficient, and scalable, always keeping the end-users in mind.
